**Bublenz — Youth Media & Information Literacy + Mental Health**
Bublenz lets young people see their algorithm bubble. It tracks what they browse (via API or demo ingest), runs topic analysis, visualizes an “information diet” pie chart, and turns the last 30 minutes of posts into an interactive simulation where users adjust weights (diversity, novelty, friend, etc.) to feel how ranking changes.
An AI companion (Bobo, Gemini 1.5 Flash) explains metrics and offers gentle, non-judgmental support. Gamified tasks + cosmetics keep it fun—without hijacking the core learning.

## üî• About the Project

Bublenz is a **mobile-first prototype** designed for youths to explore **algorithmic transparency** and **mental well-being**.  
Instead of punishing screen time, Bublenz allows users to:
- **Track** the content they consume in a 30-minute session (via official APIs or demo ingest).
- **Analyze** each post using lightweight NLP to classify topics (education, tech, entertainment, etc.).
- **Visualize** their ‚Äúinformation diet‚Äù with a pie chart.
- **Simulate** feed ranking by adjusting sliders (diversity, novelty, friend weight) and see the impact instantly.
- Get non-judgmental **emotional support** from the AI companion **Bobo** and have fun customizing it with **gamification rewards**.
